# 96-Well-Plate.py

Takes a 96 well plate used in biological assays (8 x 12 matrix) and converts the position of the well from its row (A-H) and column (1-12) name (i.e. "A1, "A6", "B12", etc) and converts it into its integer name form (i.e. "A1" = 1, "B12" = 24, "H12" = 96) and vice-versa.  

The utility of my open source code helps both the robotic analyzer and researcher to easily know and translate the position of the well in the experiment, normally used in ELISA analysis.
