# 96-Well-Plate.py

Takes a 96 well plate used in biological assays (8 x 12 matrix) and converts the position of the well from its row (A-H) and column (1-12) name (i.e. "A1, "A6", "B12", etc) into its integer form (i.e. "A1" = 1, "B12" = 24, "H12" = 96) and vice-versa.  

The utility of my open source code helps both the robotic analyzer and researcher to easily identify and translate the position of the well in the experiment, commonly used in ELISA analysis.
